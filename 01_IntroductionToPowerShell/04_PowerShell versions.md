PowerShell has evolved significantly since its initial release, leading to the creation of two distinct versions: **Windows PowerShell** and **PowerShell Core** (now simply referred to as **PowerShell 7**). Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison of the two versions:

### 1. **Definition**
- **Windows PowerShell**: The original version of PowerShell that was built on the .NET Framework. It is primarily designed for Windows environments and is included with Windows operating systems.
  
- **PowerShell Core**: A cross-platform version of PowerShell built on .NET Core (now .NET 5+). It is designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a versatile tool for system administrators and developers across different platforms.

### 2. **Platform Support**
- **Windows PowerShell**:
  - Runs only on Windows.
  - Includes support for Windows-specific features and APIs, such as WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) and COM (Component Object Model).

- **PowerShell Core**:
  - Cross-platform support, running on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  - Designed to work with platform-agnostic features, while still maintaining access to certain OS-specific functionalities.

### 3. **Versioning**
- **Windows PowerShell**: The last version is 5.1, which was released alongside Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. Development for this version has effectively ceased.
  
- **PowerShell Core**: The versioning transitioned to a new system starting with PowerShell 6, and current versions are labeled simply as **PowerShell 7.x** (the latest stable release as of now is 7.3). PowerShell 7 includes several enhancements and features not available in Windows PowerShell.

### 4. **Features and Functionality**
- **Windows PowerShell**:
  - Rich support for Windows-specific features, like **Active Directory** cmdlets.
  - Some cmdlets and modules are only available in Windows PowerShell due to its reliance on Windows APIs.

- **PowerShell Core**:
  - Improved performance and functionality due to the underlying .NET Core framework.
  - New features such as the `ForEach-Object -Parallel` parameter, `Get-Error`, and support for SSH-based remoting.
  - A broader and more modern set of APIs and modules designed to work across platforms.

### 5. **Module Compatibility**
- **Windows PowerShell**:
  - Some older modules and scripts may not work in PowerShell Core due to differences in the underlying framework and cmdlet compatibility.

- **PowerShell Core**:
  - Designed to support modern modules and is continuously being updated for compatibility with .NET Core and the broader PowerShell community.
  - Compatibility modules (like Windows Compatibility Module) are available to help users run some Windows PowerShell modules in PowerShell Core.

### 6. **Development and Community Support**
- **Windows PowerShell**: No longer actively developed, with maintenance updates only for security and bug fixes.
  
- **PowerShell Core**: Actively developed and open-source, with regular updates, new features, and community contributions. Available on GitHub, encouraging contributions from developers worldwide.

### 7. **Scripting Language**
- Both versions share a similar syntax and scripting capabilities, allowing users familiar with Windows PowerShell to transition to PowerShell Core easily. However, users should be aware of potential differences in available cmdlets and modules.

### Summary

| Feature                            | Windows PowerShell                      | PowerShell Core (PowerShell 7)      |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Platform**                       | Windows only                           | Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) |
| **Framework**                      | .NET Framework                         | .NET Core (now .NET 5+)             |
| **Latest Version**                 | 5.1                                   | 7.x (actively developed)             |
| **Features**                       | Windows-specific features, WMI, COM   | Improved performance, cross-platform features |
| **Module Compatibility**           | Windows-specific modules               | Modern modules, some compatibility for Windows modules |
| **Development Status**             | No longer actively developed           | Actively developed and open-source   |

In conclusion, while Windows PowerShell served as the foundation for PowerShell, PowerShell Core (and the subsequent versions) marks a significant evolution, focusing on cross-platform capabilities, improved performance, and ongoing community development. For new projects and ongoing automation tasks, transitioning to PowerShell 7 is generally recommended.
