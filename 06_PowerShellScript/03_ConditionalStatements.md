Conditional statements in PowerShell allow you to execute different code based on certain conditions. The most common conditional statements are `if`, `else`, and `switch`. Here are examples of each:

### 1. **If Statement**

The `if` statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

**Example:**
```powershell
$age = 18

if ($age -ge 18) {
    Write-Host "You are an adult."
}
```

### 2. **If-Else Statement**

The `if-else` statement allows you to specify a block of code to execute if the condition is false.

**Example:**
```powershell
$age = 16

if ($age -ge 18) {
    Write-Host "You are an adult."
} else {
    Write-Host "You are a minor."
}
```

### 3. **If-ElseIf-Else Statement**

This structure allows for multiple conditions to be evaluated in sequence.

**Example:**
```powershell
$score = 75

if ($score -ge 90) {
    Write-Host "Grade: A"
} elseif ($score -ge 80) {
    Write-Host "Grade: B"
} elseif ($score -ge 70) {
    Write-Host "Grade: C"
} else {
    Write-Host "Grade: D"
}
```

### 4. **Switch Statement**

The `switch` statement evaluates a single expression against multiple possible values.

**Example:**
```powershell
$day = "Monday"

switch ($day) {
    "Monday" { Write-Host "Start of the work week." }
    "Wednesday" { Write-Host "Midweek." }
    "Friday" { Write-Host "End of the work week." }
    "Saturday" { Write-Host "Weekend!" }
    "Sunday" { Write-Host "Weekend!" }
    default { Write-Host "Just another day." }
}
```

### Summary

- Use `if` for basic conditional checks.
- Use `else` for alternative actions.
- Use `elseif` for multiple conditions.
- Use `switch` when comparing a single variable against multiple values.

# Advance SysAdmin Level Example

Here are some administrator-level PowerShell examples that incorporate conditional statements to make decisions based on the results of various checks or configurations.

### 1. **Creating a User Account with Conditional Checks**

This script checks if a user already exists before creating a new account.

```powershell
# Define user parameters
$username = "NewUser"
$password = "P@ssw0rd" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
$fullName = "New User"

# Check if the user already exists
if (-not (Get-LocalUser -Name $username -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
    # Create the new user account
    New-LocalUser -Name $username -Password $password -FullName $fullName -Description "New user account for testing"
    Write-Host "User $username created."
} else {
    Write-Host "User $username already exists."
}
```

### 2. **Checking Disk Space with Conditional Alerts**

This script checks the available disk space on all drives and sends a warning if any drive is below a certain threshold.

```powershell
# Define threshold (in GB)
$threshold = 10

# Get disk space information
$drives = Get-PSDrive -PSProvider FileSystem

foreach ($drive in $drives) {
    $freeSpaceGB = [math]::round($drive.Free / 1GB, 2)

    if ($freeSpaceGB -lt $threshold) {
        Write-Host "Warning: Drive $($drive.Name) has only $freeSpaceGB GB free space."
    } else {
        Write-Host "Drive $($drive.Name) is healthy with $freeSpaceGB GB free space."
    }
}
```

### 3. **Restarting a Service Based on Status**

This script checks the status of a service and restarts it if itâ€™s stopped.

```powershell
# Define service name
$serviceName = "wuauserv"  # Windows Update Service

# Get the service status
$service = Get-Service -Name $serviceName

if ($service.Status -eq 'Stopped') {
    Start-Service -Name $serviceName
    Write-Host "Service $serviceName was stopped and has been started."
} elseif ($service.Status -eq 'Running') {
    Write-Host "Service $serviceName is already running."
} else {
    Write-Host "Service $serviceName is in status: $($service.Status)."
}
```

### 4. **Exporting Active Directory Users with Conditional Checks**

This script checks if any users exist in Active Directory before exporting to CSV.

```powershell
# Import the Active Directory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Define the output file path
$outputPath = "C:\Temp\ADUsers.csv"

# Get user information
$users = Get-ADUser -Filter * -Property DisplayName, EmailAddress

if ($users) {
    $users | Select-Object DisplayName, EmailAddress | Export-Csv -Path $outputPath -NoTypeInformation
    Write-Host "Active Directory users exported to $outputPath."
} else {
    Write-Host "No users found in Active Directory."
}
```

### 5. **Monitoring System Uptime with Conditional Alerts**

This script checks if the system uptime is above a certain threshold and alerts accordingly.

```powershell
# Get the last boot time
$lastBootTime = (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem).LastBootUpTime
$uptime = [Management.ManagementDateTimeConverter]::ToDateTime($lastBootTime)

# Calculate the uptime duration
$uptimeDuration = (Get-Date) - $uptime

# Define threshold (in days)
$thresholdDays = 30

if ($uptimeDuration.Days -ge $thresholdDays) {
    Write-Host "Warning: System uptime exceeds $thresholdDays days."
} else {
    Write-Host "System uptime is within acceptable limits."
}
```

### Summary

These scripts demonstrate how to use conditional statements in PowerShell to perform administrative tasks based on certain conditions. This allows for more intelligent and efficient automation.
